The Pacific Fishery Officers Inspection App ("the App") is designed to assist fishery officers in conducting and managing fishery inspections. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our app.

## Information We Collect

### 1. Camera Access
- **Purpose**: The app uses the camera to scan QR codes on fishing licenses for quick data entry
- **Usage**: Camera access is only activated when you explicitly use the QR scanning feature
- **Storage**: Images are processed locally and are not stored or transmitted

### 2. Location Information
- **Purpose**: To automatically record the location where inspections are conducted
- **Usage**: GPS coordinates are captured only when creating or editing an inspection
- **Storage**: Location data is stored locally on your device with the inspection records

### 3. Inspection Data
The app collects and stores:
- Fisher information (names, license numbers, contact details)
- Vessel details
- Gear type and inspection details
- Officer notes and observations
- Inspection dates and times

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage
- All data is stored locally on your device using SQLite database
